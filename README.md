Cypress Music Library lab

I was tasked to write a script simulating a user logging into the site, entering a song, and subsequently deleting the same entry. 

I performed end-to-end (E2E) testing on a completed music library app. By the test sequence passing, I am assured that the functionality of the music library that the end user would expect is consistent and operable.
